== Privacy

Sysconex does not upload any information of any kind.  
Your browser only downloads files; it never sends data anywhere.

When you open the {uri-pages}[Sysconex] editor, all JavaScript required to run the application is downloaded and executed locally in your browser.

Because of this design, you can continue working offline once the page has been loaded.
